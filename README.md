# PickupPal

Group project intended to let users post items that they are leaving out on the curb and allows others to see these postings displayed on a map for hassle free retrieval. This app is ideal for users managing large college move-in/move-out, users in suburban settings where furniture is commonly left out on the curb, users who do not have the time nor the motivation to sell their used items, users on tight budgets, and for eco conscious users who would rather not see their former belongings be taken to the dump. It utilizes many Google Maps technologies including Geocoding, Places, and Routes APIs. Most of the UI has been created using Jetpack Compose.

Group project has been completed, this is a fork of the initial project meant for individual later updates.
